From my original documentation: 

>Inspired by Conway’s Game of Life and Donald Hoffman’s computer simulations exploring the nature of perception, this is an as-of-yet poorly defined evolution simulator.  User interactions will modify the evolutionary conditions and create interesting results.
	
 This has a half-baked UI and some features not filled out.  No one seamed to think it was as neat as I did, and it kind of got permanently backburnered.
 I hope to go back and wrap it up enough that I can just use it as a sort of lava lamp.
